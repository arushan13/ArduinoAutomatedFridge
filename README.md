This project is an **Arduino-controlled smart miniature fridge** with multiple automated features, designed to mimic the functionality of a real fridge. The system is programmed in **C++** and integrates various electronic components for enhanced functionality.  

## **Features**  

### **🔄 Automatic Door Control**  
- A **switch** is used to open and close the fridge door automatically.  
- The door operates using a **servo motor** for smooth movement.  

### **❄️ Cooling Simulation**  
- A **button-controlled computer fan** mimics the cooling feature of a real fridge.  

### **💡 LED Lighting**  
- **LEDs inside the fridge** automatically turn on when the door is opened.  

### **🌡️ Temperature Display & Adjustment**  
- An **LCD screen** displays the current temperature inside the fridge.  
- A **rotary switch** allows users to **increase or decrease** the displayed temperature.  

## **Technology & Tools Used**  
- **Arduino** for hardware control  
- **C++** for programming the system  
- **Servo motor** for automated door movement  
- **Computer fan** for cooling simulation  
- **LEDs, LCD screen, and rotary switch** for enhanced interactivity  

This project demonstrates the application of **embedded systems and automation** in a fun and interactive way. 🚀
